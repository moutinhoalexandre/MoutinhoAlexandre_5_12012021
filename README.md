## ORINOCO

"ORINOCO" is the fifth project I'm working on as part of my training with OpenClassrooms.
In this scenario, I have to create a first MVP of an e-commerce site. The emphasis was put on the functional side, rather than on the aesthetic side. The backend being already provided, I had to work on the frontend.

## Specifications

The web application will be composed of 4 pages:

- [x] A list view page: showing all items available for sale.

- [x] A "product" page, which dynamically displays the item selected by the user and allows him to customize the product and add it to his cart.

- [x] A "shopping cart" page containing a summary of the products in the cart, the total price and a form to place an order. The form data must be correct and well formatted before being sent back to the back-end.

- [x] An order confirmation page, thanking the user for the order, and indicating the total price and the order ID sent by the server.
